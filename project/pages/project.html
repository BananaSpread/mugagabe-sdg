                The school can develop its own project related to SDG 13, aligned with the challenges of the NASA Apps Challenge. This project will allow the school community (students, teachers, families) to collaborate on local climate change solutions and provide evidence of the results, such as reducing emissions or improving sustainable practices. The project can involve not only the school but also the wider community and disadvantaged sectors.
            </p>

            <h2>Steps to Develop a Project</h2>

            <ul class="project-list">
                <li><span>Project Overview: </span>Start with a clear and concise description of the project, outlining its purpose, objectives, and relevance to SDG 13: Climate Action. Explain how the project aligns with the challenges posed by the NASA Apps Challenge.</li>
            
                <li><span>Involvement of the School Community: </span>Highlight how the project engages various members of the school community, including students, teachers, and families. Discuss roles and responsibilities, emphasizing collaboration and teamwork.</li>
            
                <li><span>Local Climate Change Solutions: </span>Describe the specific climate change issues the project aims to address within the local community. Present actionable strategies and initiatives that will be implemented to mitigate these challenges.</li>
            
                <li><span>Evidence of Results: </span>Outline how the school will measure the outcomes of the project. This could include metrics such as:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                    <li>Improvement in sustainable practices within the school and community.</li>
                    <li>Engagement levels among students, families, and community members.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <li><span>Community Involvement: </span>Explain how the project will extend beyond the school to involve the wider community and disadvantaged sectors. Discuss partnerships with local organizations, businesses, or government entities that could support the initiative.</li>
            
                <li><span>Project Timeline: </span>Provide a timeline for the project's implementation, including key milestones and deadlines for specific activities or assessments.</li>
            
                <li><span>Resources and Support: </span>Identify the resources needed to successfully execute the project, including funding, materials, and human resources. Mention any support received from external organizations, such as NASA or local environmental groups.</li>
            
                <li><span>Future Sustainability: </span>Discuss plans for the project's sustainability beyond its initial implementation. Explain how the school will continue to promote climate action and engage the community in ongoing efforts.</li>
            
                <li><span>Presentation Format: </span>Choose an appropriate format for presenting the project, such as a written report, a visual presentation (slides), or a video. Ensure that the presentation is engaging and accessible to all stakeholders.</li>
            
                <li><span>Feedback and Reflection: </span>Encourage feedback from the school community and stakeholders after the presentation. Include a reflection section that allows participants to share their thoughts, suggestions, and experiences related to the project.</li>
